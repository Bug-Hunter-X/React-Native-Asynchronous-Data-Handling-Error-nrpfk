This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in React Native, but it can be tricky to debug because the error message isn't always clear. For example, consider this code:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser();
  }, []);

  const fetchUser = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user');
    const data = await response.json();
    setUser(data);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

If the `fetchUser` function hasn't completed yet, `user` will still be `null`, and trying to access `user.name` will throw a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')`.

This is particularly problematic in asynchronous operations like API calls where you are trying to display data before it has fully loaded.
